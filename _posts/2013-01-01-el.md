The Expression Language spearates standard markup from dynamic content. It's not really part of JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library), but it is a part of JavaServer Pages. Hooray!

Expressions can be destinguished by a dollar sign and some curly braces. Their main use is to echo variables into the document.

```jsp
<div>${variable}</div>
```

##Arithmetic
`+`  `-` *, / and div, % and mod`

```jsp
${1 + 1}    // 2
${1 - 1}    // 0
${5 * 5}    // 25
${5 / 5}    // 1
${5 div 5}  // 1
${5 % 5}    // 1
${5 mod 5}    // 1
```
