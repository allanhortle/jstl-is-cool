The Expression Language spearates standard markup from dynamic content. It's not really part of JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library), but it is a part of JavaServer Pages. Hooray!

Expressions can be destinguished by a dollar sign and some curly braces. Their main use is to echo variables into the document.

```jsp
<div>${variable}</div>
```
